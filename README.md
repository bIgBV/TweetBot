TweetBot
========

This is a small bot that scrapes for JNTU-HYD links from the [JNTU](http://blog.jntuworld.com) blog and tweets them.

The roadmap for this bot is as follows:
 
 * Upload it to run on Google AppEngine
 * Make it extensible so that it can function as a boilerplate code for a twitter bot.

Disclaimer
==========

As of 7-05-2014 this application cannot tweet because of the conditions in twitte's API. 

Hope this get's fixed soon.
